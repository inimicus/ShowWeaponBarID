# ShowWeaponBarID

This addon was originally created by *kokoba* and posted to [ESOUI](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info779-ShowWeaponbarId.html).

I have updated the addon to restore functionality following game and API updates.

The below is a copy of the original description for prosperity.

---

Its a simple addon that will show you a movable label on your screen which displays the number of your current weapon-bar.

it was a simple idea: if you often swap your weapon-bar in combat, sometimes you lose your overview which weapon-bar is currently active. You can move the label everywhere so you will get a better view on it.

The position will be saved account-wide (for every champion)

Set font size in commandline (chat)
/swi --fontsize x (x = between 1 and 70)
/swi --help (show more information)
